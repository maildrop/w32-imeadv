/* If you want to define a new Lisp data type, here are some
   instructions.  See the thread at
   https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-devel/2012-10/msg00561.html
   for more info.

   First, there are already a couple of Lisp types that can be used if
   your new type does not need to be exposed to Lisp programs nor
   displayed to users.  These are Lisp_Save_Value, a Lisp_Misc
   subtype; and PVEC_OTHER, a kind of vectorlike object.  The former
   is suitable for temporarily stashing away pointers and integers in
   a Lisp object.  The latter is useful for vector-like Lisp objects
   that need to be used as part of other objects, but which are never
   shown to users or Lisp code (search for PVEC_OTHER in xterm.c for
   an example).

   These two types don't look pretty when printed, so they are
   unsuitable for Lisp objects that can be exposed to users.

   To define a new data type, add one more Lisp_Misc subtype or one
   more pseudovector subtype.  Pseudovectors are more suitable for
   objects with several slots that need to support fast random access,
   while Lisp_Misc types are for everything else.  A pseudovector object
   provides one or more slots for Lisp objects, followed by struct
   members that are accessible only from C.  A Lisp_Misc object is a
   wrapper for a C struct that can contain anything you like.

   Explicit freeing is discouraged for Lisp objects in general.  But if
   you really need to exploit this, use Lisp_Misc (check free_misc in
   alloc.c to see why).  There is no way to free a vectorlike object.

   To add a new pseudovector type, extend the pvec_type enumeration;
   to add a new Lisp_Misc, extend the Lisp_Misc_Type enumeration.

   For a Lisp_Misc, you will also need to add your entry to union
   Lisp_Misc, but make sure the first word has the same structure as
   the others, starting with a 16-bit member of the Lisp_Misc_Type
   enumeration and a 1-bit GC markbit.  Also make sure the overall
   size of the union is not increased by your addition.  The latter
   requirement is to keep Lisp_Misc objects small enough, so they
   are handled faster: since all Lisp_Misc types use the same space,
   enlarging any of them will affect all the rest.  If you really
   need a larger object, it is best to use Lisp_Vectorlike instead.

   For a new pseudovector, it's highly desirable to limit the size
   of your data type by VBLOCK_BYTES_MAX bytes (defined in alloc.c).
   Otherwise you will need to change sweep_vectors (also in alloc.c).

   Then you will need to add switch branches in print.c (in
   print_object, to print your object, and possibly also in
   print_preprocess) and to alloc.c, to mark your object (in
   mark_object) and to free it (in gc_sweep).  The latter is also the
   right place to call any code specific to your data type that needs
   to run when the object is recycled -- e.g., free any additional
   resources allocated for it that are not Lisp objects.  You can even
   make a pointer to the function that frees the resources a slot in
   your object -- this way, the same object could be used to represent
   several disparate C structures.  */
